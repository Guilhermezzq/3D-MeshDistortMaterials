# Mesh Distortion Experiment

This project is an experiment that utilizes the React Three Fiber library to create distortion effects on 3D geometries. 
The main technique employed is the use of MeshDistortMaterial, a material that applies distortions to mesh geometries, resulting in wavy and interesting animations.

# Key Features:

Interactive Hover: When hovering over the geometry, the distortion effect is triggered, providing an interactive experience for the user.

Custom Configuration: The project allows for configuring the speed and intensity of the distortion, providing flexibility to adapt the effect as needed.
